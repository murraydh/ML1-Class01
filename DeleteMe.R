# and a factor named Direction with levels Down and Up indicating whether the market had a positive
# or negative return that day.

 #Observe:
#    The Priors:       These are 0.492 and 0.508 for Down and Up respectively
#    The Group means:  These are the average of each predictor
#                      within each class, and are used by LDA 
#                      as estimates of the mu's for each class
#    The coefficients: These produce the linear discriminants in the LDA decision boundry with p>1 (slide 77). 
#                      If -0.642 × Lag1 - 0.514 × Lag2 is large, then the LDA classifier will predict a market
